Ticketing System
Overview
The Ticketing System is a multi-component application that simulates a ticket selling system. The project includes three primary components:

CLI (Command-Line Interface): A Java-based application for configuring and running the ticket system using multi-threading.
Backend (Spring Boot): A RESTful API built with Spring Boot for managing ticket operations, vendor and customer activities, and providing real-time updates using WebSockets.
Frontend (React): A web-based UI for interacting with the backend, configuring system parameters, viewing logs, and receiving real-time updates via WebSocket.
Features:
Real-time Updates: View live ticket addition and consumption using WebSocket.
REST API: Configure system parameters, retrieve logs, and check system status.
Concurrency: Simulate vendors adding tickets and customers purchasing tickets in parallel.
Web Interface: A simple React frontend to configure the system and monitor logs.
Components
1. CLI (Java)
The CLI application is a multi-threaded Java program that manages ticketing processes, such as adding tickets by vendors and purchasing tickets by customers. It uses Javaâ€™s threading model for concurrency.

Features:
Interactive configuration (total tickets, release rate, customer retrieval rate, max capacity).
Simulates vendors releasing tickets and customers purchasing tickets.
Logs ticket operations to a file.
Configuration saved to JSON and text files.
Installation and Usage:
Clone or Download the repository.
Compile the Java files:
bash
Copy code
javac *.java
Run the Program:
bash
Copy code
java Main
2. Backend (Spring Boot)
The backend manages ticket operations using Spring Boot. It provides REST APIs for configuring the ticket system, logging activities, and checking the system status. Additionally, it offers real-time updates via WebSocket.

Features:
WebSocket: Real-time updates on ticket operations.
REST API: Configure the system and retrieve logs.
Concurrency: Simulates vendor ticket releases and customer purchases using threads.
Setup and Installation:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
Build the project: Using Maven:
bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Run the Spring Boot application:
bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
The backend will run on http://localhost:8080.
API Endpoints:
POST /api/configure: Configure the system with parameters.
GET /api/logs: Retrieve logs of ticket additions and purchases.
GET /api/status: Check the status of the system.
3. Frontend (React)
The frontend is built using React. It provides a user-friendly interface to configure the system, start/stop the system, view logs, and receive real-time updates.

Features:
Configuration Form: Allows users to set the total number of tickets, ticket release rate, customer retrieval rate, and maximum ticket capacity.
Real-time Logs: Displays logs of ticket operations (ticket addition, ticket purchase) in real-time.
WebSocket Integration: Receives real-time updates from the backend.
Setup and Installation:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <frontend_project_directory>
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the React app:
bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000 and communicate with the backend at http://localhost:8080.

Configuration
CLI Configuration (Java)
The CLI will prompt users for the following configuration values:

Total Tickets: Total number of tickets to be sold.
Ticket Release Rate (seconds): The rate at which vendors release tickets to the pool.
Customer Retrieval Rate (seconds): The rate at which customers retrieve tickets from the pool.
Maximum Ticket Capacity: The maximum number of tickets the pool can hold.
Backend Configuration (Spring Boot)
The backend configuration is handled via the POST /api/configure endpoint, where you send a JSON object with the same fields as in the CLI configuration.

Example Request:
json
Copy code
{
  "totalTickets": 100,
  "ticketReleaseRate": 2,
  "customerRetrievalRate": 3,
  "maxTicketCapacity": 50
}
Frontend Configuration (React)
The frontend provides input fields for the same configuration values. Once the user enters the values, they can click Save Configuration to send the data to the backend.

WebSocket Integration
The WebSocket endpoint /ticket-status is used for real-time updates. It allows the frontend to receive notifications such as:

"Ticket added - Ticket ID: 1"
"Ticket bought - Ticket ID: 1"
The frontend listens to the WebSocket and updates the UI accordingly.

Logs
Backend Logs
Logs are stored in-memory and can be accessed via the /api/logs endpoint. The logs include messages like:

Ticket added: When a vendor adds a ticket to the pool.
Ticket bought: When a customer purchases a ticket.
Frontend Logs
The frontend displays these logs in real-time as they are updated via the WebSocket connection or periodically fetched from the /api/logs endpoint.

Control Flow
Backend: The backend receives the configuration via the /api/configure endpoint. It starts the simulation by running vendor and customer threads in parallel. Vendors release tickets, and customers retrieve tickets from the pool. Logs are generated throughout the process.

Frontend: The frontend provides a configuration form where users can input the ticket system parameters. Once saved, it sends the configuration to the backend. Users can also view the live ticket status via logs, which are updated in real-time using WebSocket.
